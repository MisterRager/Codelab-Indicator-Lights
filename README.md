The "Internet of Things" is everywhere now, and no piece of hardware makes it easier to build a Thing for the Internet than the ESP32 from Espressif Systems. The follow-up to the wildly popular WiFi-enabled microcontroller, the ESP8266, the ESP32 packs twice the cores (2), adds bluetooth, and greatly expands the number of GPIO's and peripherals available. Procede to the [wiki](https://github.com/MisterRager/Codelab-Indicator-Lights/wiki) and learn how to manipulate neopixel lights, make web requests, and handle multitasking in FreeRTOS.
